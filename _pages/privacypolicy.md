### 1\. PERSONAL DATA WE COLLECT AND HOW WE COLLECT IT

We may collect Personal Data from and about you:

-   Directly from you when you provide it to us.
-   Automatically when you use PixVibe. Information collected automatically may include Usage details and internet protocol (“**IP**”) addresses.
-   From third parties, for example, our service providers, partners and vendors.

### 2\. PERSONAL DATA YOU PROVIDE TO US DIRECTLY

You may provide Personal Data to us directly, or to service providers that act on our behalf, when you use PixVibe. The Personal Data you provide depends on which features of PixVibe you use and how you interact with the app.

-   **Photos and (or) videos that you upload to PixVibe.** If you grant us permission to access your camera or your device’s photo library, we will process the photos and videos you select to upload to PixVibe to provide features of the app that you choose to use. For more information regarding how we process your photos and videos, please see [Section 3: How We Process, Share and Retain Your Photos, Videos and Image Data.](https://objecteraser.github.io/privacypolicy#section-3)
-   **Information Regarding Gender.** When you use the avatar generation feature of the app, we ask you to select the gender you want to be associated with the Avatar. You can select Female, Male, or Other. This information is used solely to generate the Avatars in accordance with the indicated gender: for example, if you choose to identify your gender as a female, then you will receive conventionally more feminine-like Avatars. If you do not want to select a gender, please select “Other”.
-   **Account Information.** When you create a PixVibe account, we ask you to provide your email address. If you log in with your Apple ID we will receive your Apple ID and may receive the email address associated with your Apple ID, depending on your Apple settings. If you log in via your Google Account we will receive your associated email address.
-   If you contact us or communicate with us, we will collect and receive **records and copies of your correspondence with us and contact details that you have provided us while making your inquiries** (such as your name, postal addresses, email addresses and phone numbers or any other identifier by which you may be contacted).

### 3\. HOW WE PROCESS, SHARE, AND RETAIN YOUR PHOTOS, VIDEOS AND IMAGE DATA

We process your photos and videos to provide you with the features of the PixVibe application that you choose to use. In doing so, when you upload photos or videos to PixVibe, we process your photos and videos using technology that identifies data that is in the photos and videos and provides us with information, such as information about your facial position, orientation and topology (“**Face Data**”), and other elements of your photo (collectively, “**Image Data**”). The following describes how we process, share, and retain your photos, videos and Image Data in connection with various features of the PixVibe app. Please note, however, that we may retain your data for longer time periods than set forth below where required to do so by law.

-   **Photo & Video Editing.** We will automatically apply technology to generate Image Data and Face Data. Your original photo and Image Data is stored on our servers. We store the original photo to which you apply editings and the resulting Image Data on our servers for no longer than 24 hours, after which time the original photo and any associated Image Data is deleted.
-   **Avatars.** To generate Avatars, you must upload 10-20 photos to PixVibe and select a gender to be associated with the Avatar. The photos you upload are stored on our servers. The avatar generation feature relies on the AI model. We create a copy of the AI model, which is hosted on our servers, and apply technology that retrains the model using the photos you uploaded and generates Image Data to create and personalize your Avatars. Immediately after the successful generation of Avatars, your original photos, the copy of the AI model, as well as any associated Image Data, are deleted permanently from our servers. We do not use your Personal Data to train and/or create separate artificial intelligence/products.
-   **Your Avatars** are stored on our servers and are available to you within the PixVibe app at any time, via any device from which you log into the PixVibe application, until you decide to either (i) delete the Avatars or, (ii) delete your PixVibe account. If you delete an Avatar, we will generally process the deletion within 4 hours. If you delete your PixVibe account, we will generally delete your account, including the Avatars in your account, within 4 hours. **Please be aware that deleting the PixVibe application from your device does not result in the deletion of your PixVibe account!**

### 4\. PERSONAL DATA WE COLLECT AUTOMATICALLY

When you use PixVibe, we or third parties we permit to do so, may automatically collect certain information, including Personal Data, from you (this is subject to your consent where this is required by law). The information collected from you automatically when you use PixVibe may include:

Such Affiliates are bound by appropriate contractual safeguards.
-   We may disclose your Personal Data, and other collected information to third-party organizations such as **contractors, business partners, service providers, and vendors that we use to support our business** and who assist us in providing PixVibe. 
-   We may disclose your Personal Data to **third-party analytics providers and advertising partners** or otherwise permit them to collect or access it.

### 7\. COOKIES, SOFTWARE DEVELOPMENT KITS, AND OTHER TRACKING TECHNOLOGIES

When you use PixVibe, we and our service providers, vendors, and partners, including third parties, may use cookies (a small text file placed on your computer or mobile device to identify your computer and web browser) and other similar technologies to collect or receive certain information about you and/or your use of PixVibe. We also use third-party analytics tools like Google Firebase, Facebook Analytics to help us measure traffic and usage trends for PixVibe and for other purposes. Such analytics tools collect information via third-party SDKs incorporated into PixVibe, which includes information about features of PixVibe you visit or use, your actions in PixVibe, and information about your subscription. Such information may be used to provide content, advertising, or functionality or to measure and analyze ad performance on PixVibe or other websites or platforms.

**Interest-based Advertising**. We may partner with ad networks and other ad-serving providers that serve ads on behalf of us and others on non-affiliated platforms. Some of those ads may be personalized, meaning that they are intended to be relevant to you based on information ad networks and ad serving providers collect about your use of the app over time, including information about relationships among different browsers and devices. This type of advertising is known as interest-based advertising.

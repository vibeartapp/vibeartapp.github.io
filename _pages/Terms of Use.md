## 5\. USER CONTENT

TL;DR: You can upload your photos to Lensa and create amazing Avatars. Your original content and your AI-generated content belong to you, and we claim no ownership over such content. You would need to give us a permission to use that content (for our AI to generate you Avatars). You take this permission away when your Avatars are ready.

Lensa may allow you to upload, edit, create, store and share content, including photos and videos, as well as generate and download your Magic Avatars (“User Content”). We do not claim ownership over your User Content.

We want you to enjoy the functionality of Lensa seamlessly, therefore, we would require a permit (called a license and referenced as a “Company License” explained further) to use your User Content uploaded to the application. We would like to highlight that the Company license is limited within both the purpose of our usage of your User Content and parties we might share this User Content with. Sharing of your User Content would be typically limited to our service providers and/or affiliates, which ensure that the application is functioning as intended. We do not sell or share otherwise any of your User Content with irrelevant third parties and do not receive any proceeds out of its usage, except for ensuring the appropriate functionality and further development of the application.

If you upload someone else’s content to Lensa and we receive claims, you will indemnify Lensa for such claims (it means that we will ask you to financially compensate us these claims). We encourage you to observe these rules and not harm others using their content without consent.

## 11\. INDEMNIFICATION

TL;DR: if you breach the rules, and we receive claims for it, we may ask you to compensate us financially. 

To the fullest extent permitted by applicable law, you will indemnify, defend, and hold harmless us and each of our respective officers, directors, agents, partners and employees (individually and collectively, “Company Parties”) from and against any loss, liability, claim, demand, damages, expenses or costs (“Claims”) arising out of or related to (i) your Use of Lensa; (ii) your User Content or Feedback; (iii) your violation of these Terms; (iv) your violation, misappropriation or infringement of any rights of another (including intellectual property rights or privacy rights); and (v) your conduct in connection with Lensa. You agree to promptly notify the Company Parties of any third party Claims, cooperate with the Company Parties in defending such Claims and pay all fees, costs and expenses associated with defending such Claims (including, but not limited to, attorneys’ fees). You also agree that the Company Parties will have control of the defense or settlement of any third party Claims. This indemnity is in addition to, and not in lieu of, any other indemnities set forth in a written agreement between you and us or the other Company Parties.

## 12\. DISCLAIMERS

TL;DR: Sometimes the things may not work out as planned. And we don’t claim or guarantee that Lensa will always work perfectly. Just as we can’t claim or guarantee that you won’t see any unexpected results while generating your Avatars – it’s very unpredictable, although we are always working on AI’s safety settings.

We do not control, endorse or take responsibility for any User Content (and its loss) or third-party content linked to Lensa. You acknowledge sole responsibility for and assume all risk arising from your use of any third-party websites or resources.

Your Use of Lensa is at your sole risk. Lensa is provided “as is” and “as available” without warranties of any kind, either express or implied, including, but not limited to, implied warranties of merchantability, fitness for a particular purpose, title, and non-infringement. In addition, we do not represent or warrant that Lensa is accurate, complete, reliable, current or error-free, free of viruses or other harmful components. You assume the entire risk as to the quality and performance of Lensa within your Use.

Magic Avatars feature uses external technology Stable Diffusion AI. Due to this, we cannot fully control the results generated by the Magic Avatars feature, and therefore these  Avatars in no way represent our official policy or position on religion, ethnic group, club, organization, company, individual, or anyone or anything. We make reasonable efforts to moderate the Magic Avatars feature by configuring the AI setting, which, in any case, are only those that are accessible to us. We do not and cannot moderate the User Content. By agreeing to the Terms and/or purchasing a subscription, you agree to the above disclaimer and waive any claims against us due to the generated  Avatars.

## 13\. LIMITATION OF LIABILITY

The Company, as well as Company’s representatives or affiliates (the “Company Parties”) will not be liable to you under any theory of liability — whether based on contract, tort, negligence, strict liability, warranty, or otherwise — for any indirect, consequential, exemplary, incidental, punitive or special damages or lost profits, even if you have been advised of the possibility of such damages.

The total liability of the Company and the other Company Parties, for any claim arising out of or relating to these Terms or Lensa, regardless of the form of the action, is limited to the amount paid, if any, by you to Use Lensa. In no event will the Company’s total liability arising out of or in connection with these Terms or from the Use of or inability to Use Lensa exceed the amounts you have paid to Use Lensa or ten ($10) U.S. dollars, if you have not had any payment obligations to the Company, as applicable. The exclusion and limitations of damages set forth above are fundamental elements of the basis of the bargain between the Company and you.

The limitations set forth in this Section will not limit or exclude liability for fraud or intentional misconduct of the Company or the other Company Parties or for any other matters in which liability cannot be excluded or limited under applicable law. Additionally, some jurisdictions do not allow the exclusion or limitation of incidental or consequential damages, so the above limitations or exclusions may not apply to you.

## 14\. RELEASE

To the fullest extent permitted by applicable law, you release the Company and the other Company Parties from responsibility, liability, claims, demands, and/or damages (actual and consequential) of every kind and nature, known and unknown (including, but not limited to, claims of negligence), arising out of or related to disputes between the Users and the acts or omissions of third parties. You expressly waive any rights you may have under California Civil Code § 1542 as well as any other statute or common law principles that would otherwise limit the coverage of this release to include only those claims that you may know or suspect to exist in your favor at the time of agreeing to this release.

## 15\. DISPUTE RESOLUTION; BINDING ARBITRATION

Please read the following Section carefully because it requires you to arbitrate certain disputes and claims with the Company and limits the manner in which you can seek relief from us.

Except for small claims disputes in which you or the Company seek to bring an individual action in small claims court located in the county of your billing address or disputes in which you or the Company seeks injunctive or other equitable relief for the alleged unlawful use of intellectual property, you and the Company waive your rights to a jury trial and to have any dispute arising out of or related to these Terms or Lensa resolved in court. Instead, all disputes arising out of or relating to these Terms or Lensa will be resolved through confidential binding arbitration held in Santa Clara County, California in accordance with the Streamlined Arbitration Rules and Procedures (“Rules”) of the Judicial Arbitration and Mediation Services (“JAMS”), which are available on the JAMS website and hereby incorporated by reference. You either acknowledge and agree that you have read and understand the rules of JAMS or waive your opportunity to read the rules of JAMS and any claim that the rules of JAMS are unfair or should not apply for any reason.

ANY ARBITRATION UNDER THESE TERMS BY EITHER YOU OR US WILL ONLY BE ON AN INDIVIDUAL BASIS; CLASS ARBITRATIONS, CLASS ACTIONS, REPRESENTATIVE ACTIONS, AND CONSOLIDATION WITH OTHER ARBITRATIONS ARE NOT PERMITTED. YOU WAIVE ANY RIGHT TO HAVE YOUR CASE DECIDED BY A JURY AND YOU WAIVE ANY RIGHT TO PARTICIPATE IN A CLASS ACTION AGAINST US.

You and the Company agree that these Terms affect interstate commerce and that the enforceability of this Section will be substantively and procedurally governed by the Federal Arbitration Act, 9 U.S.C. § 1, et seq. (“FAA”), to the maximum extent permitted by applicable law. As limited by the FAA, these Terms and the Rules, the arbitrator will have exclusive authority to make all procedural and substantive decisions regarding any dispute and to grant any remedy that would otherwise be available in court; provided, however, that the arbitrator does not have the authority to conduct a class arbitration or a representative action, which is prohibited by these Terms. The arbitrator may only conduct an individual arbitration and may not consolidate more than one individual’s claims, preside over any type of class or representative proceeding or preside over any proceeding involving more than one individual. You and the Company agree that for any arbitration you initiate, you will pay the filing fee and the Company will pay the remaining JAMS fees and costs. For any arbitration initiated by the Company, the Company will pay all JAMS fees and costs. You and the Company agree that the state or federal courts of the State of California and the United States sitting in Santa Clara County, California have exclusive jurisdiction over any appeals and the enforcement of an arbitration award.

ANY CLAIM ARISING OUT OF OR RELATED TO THESE TERMS OR LENSA MUST BE FILED WITHIN ONE YEAR AFTER SUCH CLAIM AROSE; OTHERWISE, THE CLAIM IS PERMANENTLY BARRED, WHICH MEANS THAT YOU AND THE COMPANY WILL NOT HAVE THE RIGHT TO ASSERT THE CLAIM.

You have the right to opt out of binding arbitration within 30 days of the date you first accepted the terms of this Section by notifying the Company in writing. The notification must be sent to:

Prisma Labs, Inc.

## 16\. GOVERNING LAW AND VENUE

TL;DR: this agreement is governed by the laws of the State of California.

These Terms and your Use of Lensa will be governed by, construed and enforced in accordance with the laws of the State of California, without regard to conflict of law rules or principles (whether of California or any other jurisdiction) that would cause the application of the laws of any other jurisdiction. However, some countries (including those in the European Union) have laws that require agreements to be governed by the local laws of the user's country. This paragraph doesn’t override those laws.

Any dispute between you and the Company that is not subject to arbitration or cannot be heard in small claims court will be resolved in the state or federal courts of California and the United States, respectively, sitting in Santa Clara County, California.
